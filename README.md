The game is about a developer who tries every day to stop enemies (black cats inspired by GitHub's mascot Mona) from overwhelming the field.

Grass Tower Defense is a strategic tower defense game inspired by GitHub’s contribution graph, which is famous for its grid of green squares. In South Korea, this graph is affectionately known as the “grass field” (잔디밭), and developers often say they “plant grass” (잔디를 심는다) every day they contribute code. This charming metaphor represents daily progress as if nurturing a lawn, where each contribution adds a fresh patch of green grass.

Game Introduction
This is a tower defense game inspired by GitHub's commit graph. Build towers and defend against monsters.

# How to play
1. Enter your GitHub username and start playing. (it doesn't matter if it doesn't exist)
2. Click “Work” to gain contribution points and build towers.
3. If you have caffeine, your work will proceed automatically, though at a slower pace.
4. Enemies are black cats inspired by Mona, GitHub’s mascot.
5. If too many black cats (30) overwhelm the field, it’s game over.
6. You cannot plant grass for previous days.
7. Towers grow stronger with more contributions: 0 commits / 1-3 commits / 4-6 commits / 7-9 commits / 10+ commits.
