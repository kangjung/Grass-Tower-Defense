The game is about a developer who tries every day to stop enemies (black cats inspired by GitHub's mascot Mona) from overwhelming the field.

Grass Tower Defense is a strategic tower defense game inspired by GitHub’s contribution graph, famous for its grid of green squares. In Korea, this graph is lovingly called the “grass field” (잔디밭), and developers often say they “plant grass” (잔디를 심는다) each day they contribute code. This delightful metaphor highlights daily progress as if nurturing a lawn — with each contribution representing a fresh patch of green grass.

The name "Grass Tower Defense" reflects the concept of continuous effort and growth through GitHub's content graph, and I wanted to combine programming culture and gameplay.
